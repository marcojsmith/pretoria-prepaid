# Project Overview

This project is focused on developing a digital application with real-time capabilities, user authentication, and a responsive user interface.

- Our goal is to develop a fully functional production-ready application that can be deployed and used by real users. This means that we need to ensure that the application is functional, secure, scalable, and maintainable.
- We must deliver a high-quality codebase that adheres to best practices and coding standards, and that is well-documented to facilitate future development and maintenance.
- We must architect the application in a way that allows for easy integration of new features and improvements in the future, ensure type safety across the codebase, and maintain a consistent design language throughout the application.
- Focus on efficient bandwidth usage and performance optimization to ensure a smooth user experience, especially for users with limited internet connectivity.

# Rules & Guidelines

## Senior Developer Mindset

- Always consider the broader context of the project and how your changes fit into the overall architecture and design of the application.
- Prioritize code quality, data efficiency, code maintainability, and scalability in all your work.
- Be proactive in identifying potential issues and improvements, and take the initiative to address them.
- Communicate clearly and effectively with the team, providing constructive feedback and collaborating to achieve the best possible outcome for the project.
- Stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in software development, and continuously seek opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.

## Folder Structure

- `app/`: Main application directory.
  - `convex/`: Backend logic, database schema, and server-side functions using Convex.
  - `src/`: Frontend React application source code.
    - `assets/`: Static assets like images, fonts, and styles.
    - `components/`: Reusable UI components (using shadcn/ui).
    - `contexts/`: React context providers for global state.
    - `hooks/`: Custom React hooks for state and logic.
    - `lib/`: Utility functions and shared application logic.
    - `pages/`: Application views and routing.
    - `test/`: Frontend tests (Vitest, MCP).
    - `types/`: TypeScript type definitions.
- `conductor/`: Project management documentation, guidelines, and feature tracks.
- `.gemini/`: Gemini CLI-specific configurations, rules, and specialized skills.

## Tech stack

**Frontend:** React (Vite), TypeScript.

**Backend/Database:** Convex (Real-time auction state synchronization).

- Important files to consider:
  - `app/convex/auctions/*` (index.ts, queries.ts, mutations.ts, helpers.ts, bidding.ts): Contains the auction logic.
  - `app/convex/auth.ts`, `app/convex/auth.config.ts`: Handles user authentication and management.
  - `app/convex/convex.config.ts`, `app/convex/config.ts`: Convex configuration files.
  - `app/convex/schema.ts`: Defines the database schema for the application.
  - `app/convex/seed.ts`: Contains seed data for the database.
  - `app/convex/http.ts`: Handles HTTP requests and API routes.

**Authentication:** Clerk (for user authentication and management).

- Important to note, the Clerk logic is implemented in the `app/convex/auth.ts` and `app/convex/auth.config.ts` files, which are part of the Convex backend. This means that user authentication and management are handled on the server side, ensuring secure access to the application.
- Also, the Clerk component is defined in `app/convex/convex.config.ts`, which is the main configuration file for the Convex backend. This allows for seamless integration of authentication features into the overall application architecture.

**Testing:** Chrome DevTools MCP (E2E/UI), Vitest.

## Operational Rules

**Reading files:**

- When you need to read a file, read the entire file if possible. This will help you understand the full context and avoid missing any important information that may be relevant to the task at hand. If the file is too large to read in one go, try to read it in sections, but make sure to keep track of the overall structure and context of the file as you read through it.
- Use the ReadFile tool to read files, and read as many files at once as possible to get a comprehensive understanding of the codebase and the specific files that are relevant to the task you are working on.

**Running development server:**

- Assume the development and convex servers are already running when making changes.

**Legacy code and data:**

- We are developing a new digital prototype, so there is no legacy code or data to consider. All code and data should be treated as new and can be modified freely.
- Changing code could cause data issues, so be mindful of any data-related changes that need to be made as part of code changes and ensure that they are properly tested.

**Commits and Branches:**

- Follow the commit message format specified in `Checklist.md` for all commits. Ensure the commit message is clear, concise, and accurately describes the changes made in the commit.
- Create branches for each new feature or bug fix, following the naming convention `feature/description` or `bugfix/description`.
- When committing changes, group the changes by functionality or related changes, and avoid making large commits that include unrelated changes. This will make it easier to review and understand the changes being made.

**Pull Requests:**

- Open a pull request for each completed feature or bug fix.
- Include a clear description of the changes made and reference any relevant issues or tasks.
- Ensure that all automated tests pass before requesting a review.

**Cohesive Code Changes:**

- When making code changes, ensure that they are cohesive and related to a single feature or bug fix. Avoid making unrelated changes in the same commit or pull request, as this can make it difficult to review and understand the changes.
- If you need to make multiple unrelated changes, consider breaking them into separate commits or pull requests to maintain clarity and ease of review.
- Make sure when adding a feature or fixing a bug, you consider all the necessary changes that need to be made across the codebase, including any related data changes, and ensure that they are all included in the same cohesive set of changes. Consider frontend changes, backend changes, database schema or seed data, security implications, testing changes, documentation updates, and any other relevant changes that are necessary to fully implement the feature or fix the bug in a cohesive manner.

**Code Changes:**

- Prefer making multiple changes at once when making code changes to a file, this saves on the overhead of making agentic code changes. For example, if you need to make several changes to a file, it is more efficient to make all the necessary changes in one go rather than making multiple separate changes to the same file. This will help reduce the overall time and effort required to make the changes and ensure that all related changes are made together in a cohesive manner.

**Committing Changes:**

- When committing changes, ensure that your commit message accurately describes the changes made in the commit.
- Group related changes together in a single commit to maintain cohesion and clarity in the commit history. Avoid making large commits that include unrelated changes, as this can make it difficult to review and understand the changes being made.
- Before committing, ensure that all tests are passing and that there are no linting errors in the codebase. This will help maintain code quality and ensure that the changes being committed meet the project's standards.
- After committing, push the changes to the appropriate branch to allow for code review and integration into the main codebase.

## Semantic Versioning

Follow [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) to manage the version in `app/package.json`. The version is injected at build time into the application via Vite and displayed in the AdminDashboard.

**When to update the version:**

| Change Type                                               | Version Bump          | Example       |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| Bug fixes, typo corrections, UI tweaks                    | **Patch** (x.y.**Z**) | 0.1.0 → 0.1.1 |
| New features, non-breaking functionality                  | **Minor** (x.**Y**.z) | 0.1.0 → 0.2.0 |
| Breaking changes, major refactors, significant milestones | **Major** (**X**.y.z) | 0.1.0 → 1.0.0 |

**Guidelines:**

- Always update `app/package.json` version BEFORE merging a PR that introduces changes.
- Include the version bump in the same commit/PR as the changes themselves.
- The version flows automatically from `package.json` through Vite's build process to the running application (see `app/vite.config.ts` and `app/src/vite-env.d.ts`).

## Coding Rules

**Types**

- Use TypeScript for all frontend and backend code in Convex (files use .ts extension).
- Do not use `any` type in TypeScript. Always strive to use specific types to ensure type safety and improve code readability.
- Use JSDoc comments for all code.
- Define interfaces and types for all data structures and function parameters/returns to ensure clarity and maintainability of the codebase.
- Use type guards and type assertions where necessary to ensure that the code is type-safe and to prevent potential runtime errors.
- Do not use eslint-disable or any other means to bypass type checking. If you encounter a situation where you feel the need to disable type checking, take a step back and consider how you can refactor the code to properly handle the types instead.
- When you encounter warnings like "warning Unused eslint-disable directive (no problems were reported)", this means that there is an eslint-disable comment in the code that is not actually disabling any eslint rules, which can be a sign of leftover or unnecessary code. In this case, you should remove the unused eslint-disable directive to clean up the code and ensure that it is clear and maintainable.
- When you encounter code that has "eslint-disable" comments, this means that there are certain eslint rules that have been disabled for that section of code. This can be a sign that there may be issues with the code that are being ignored, which can lead to potential bugs or maintainability issues in the future. In this case, you should review the code carefully and consider whether it is possible to refactor the code to comply with the eslint rules instead of disabling them. If it is necessary to disable certain eslint rules, make sure to document the reasons for doing so and ensure that the code is still well-structured and maintainable.

**Code Style:**

- Follow the code style guidelines specified in `conductor/code_styleguides/typescript.md`, `conductor/code_styleguides/javascript.md`, and `conductor/code_styleguides/html-css.md` for all code written in the respective languages. This will help ensure that the codebase is consistent, readable, and maintainable across the entire project.
- Use meaningful variable and function names that accurately describe their purpose and functionality. This will improve code readability and make it easier for other developers to understand the codebase.
- Write modular and reusable code by breaking down complex functions into smaller, more focused functions. This will improve code maintainability and make it easier to test and debug the codebase.
- Avoid code duplication by creating reusable components and functions. This will help reduce the overall codebase size and improve maintainability.
- Ensure that all code is well-documented with clear comments explaining the purpose and functionality of complex code sections. This will help other developers understand the codebase and make it easier to maintain and update the code in the future.
- Regularly review and refactor the codebase to improve code quality, readability, and maintainability. This will help ensure that the codebase remains clean and efficient as the project evolves and grows over time.

**Best Practices:**

- Follow React best practices for frontend development, including the use of functional components, hooks, and composition patterns to create a clean and maintainable codebase.
- Use shadcn/ui components for building the user interface, and customize them as needed to fit the design and functionality requirements of the application. This will help ensure a consistent and cohesive design language throughout the application while also leveraging the benefits of using a component library.
- Follow web design guidelines for creating a user-friendly and accessible interface, including considerations for layout, typography, color schemes, and responsive design. This will help ensure that the application is easy to use and provides a positive user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
- Always consider the user experience when making design and development decisions, and strive to create an intuitive and enjoyable experience for the users of the application. This includes providing clear feedback for user actions, ensuring that the interface is easy to navigate, and minimizing any potential friction points in the user journey.
- Do not shy away from making significant changes to the codebase or design if it will lead to a better overall outcome for the project. Always prioritize the quality and maintainability of the codebase and the user experience over making small, incremental changes that may not have a significant impact.

**Naming conventions:**

- You MUST use consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, components, and files throughout the codebase. These conventions are strictly enforced.
- For folders you MUST use hyphen-case (e.g., `user-profile`)
- For React component files you MUST use PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`, `MyComponent.tsx`)
- For utility/module files you MUST use camelCase or kebab-case depending on context (e.g., `queries.ts`, `mutations.ts`, `helpers.ts`, `bidding.ts`, `authConfig.ts` or `auth-config.ts`)
- For variables and functions you MUST use camelCase (e.g., `getUserProfile`)
- For React components you MUST use PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile`).
- Naming conventions are enforced via linting rules. Deviations from these conventions will cause build failures.

## UI Design Rules

**Clarity:**

- Ensure all UI elements are clear and intuitive.
- For example, using clear labels for buttons and form fields, and providing tooltips or help text where necessary to guide users through the interface.
- Make sure that the layout is organized and that important information is prominently displayed.

**Consistency:**

- Maintain a consistent design language throughout the application.
- For example, using the same button styles, colors, and typography across all pages and components.
- Follow the design guidelines provided in `conductor/product-guidelines.md` to ensure a cohesive and user-friendly interface.

**Accessibility:**

Follow best practices for accessibility (e.g., ARIA roles, keyboard navigation).

**Responsiveness:**

- Design for the following screen sizes:
  - Mobile: 375px width, 812px height (e.g., iPhone 14 Pro).
  - Tablet: 768px width, 1024px height (e.g., iPad).
  - Desktop: 1440px width, 900px height (e.g., MacBook Pro).
- Use responsive design techniques (e.g., media queries, flexible layouts) to ensure the application looks and functions well on all devices.

**Feedback:**

Provide users with clear feedback for their actions (e.g., loading indicators, success/error messages).

**Simplicity:**

Avoid clutter and unnecessary elements.

**Theming:**

- Use a cohesive color scheme and typography that aligns with the application's brand.
- Make use of the defined theme styles, and do not hardcode colors or fonts directly in components.
- If a new theme style is needed, define it in the theme configuration.

**skills:**

- Use the frontend, react-best-practice, react-composition-patterns, shadcn, and web-design-guidelines skills to inform your UI design decisions and implementation.

**Componentization:**

- Break down the UI into reusable components, following React best practices and composition patterns.
- When a component is needed, install it from shadcn if available, and customize it as needed to fit the design and functionality requirements of the application.
- Ensure that components are well-documented and maintainable, with clear props definitions and usage examples.

**Testing & Verification:**

- UI and UX is hard, and it's easy to make mistakes or overlook important details.
- Always test your UI changes thoroughly, and use tools like Chrome DevTools MCP to verify that the UI functions correctly and provides a good user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
- Do not assume that your first attempt at implementing a UI change is correct or suitable.
- Always verify and test your changes, and be open to making adjustments and experimenting with different approaches to achieve the best possible outcome for the user.

## Code Reviews

**General notes:**

- When performing code reviews, focus on the following aspects:
  - Code quality and readability.
  - Adherence to coding standards and best practices.
  - Proper testing and coverage.
  - Security implications of the changes.
  - Overall impact on the project and any potential issues or improvements.
  - Unused imports, variables or code, and any opportunities to clean up the codebase.
  - Refactoring opportunities to improve code structure and maintainability.
  - Unfinished or placeholder code that may have been left in the codebase, and ensuring that all code is complete and ready for production.
  - Documentation updates that may be necessary as part of the changes, and ensuring that all relevant documentation is updated accordingly. Including the README.md, codebase_notes.md, and any relevant documentation in the `conductor/` folder.
- Provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement, and be open to discussion and collaboration with the author of the changes. Always aim to improve the overall quality of the codebase and ensure that the changes align with the project's goals and standards.

**Step 1: Local Code Review (CodeRabbit CLI)**

- Before committing any changes, you must run the CodeRabbit CLI to analyze your uncommitted changes.
- **Command:** `coderabbit --prompt-only --type uncommitted`
- **Review Findings:** Carefully review the output from CodeRabbit. It will identify potential issues such as race conditions, logic errors, or security vulnerabilities.
- **Address Issues:** For each finding:
  - Evaluate if it is a critical issue, a meaningful improvement, or a nit.
  - Fix major and critical issues immediately.
  - Consider implementing meaningful improvements.
  - You may ignore nits if they are not applicable to the current context.
- **Verification:** After implementing fixes, run the command again to ensure the issues are resolved and no new bugs were introduced.

**Step 2: List files and folders to Review**

- Using terminal commands, list all the files and folders within the project that are not part of the .gitignore file.
- This will help you identify all the relevant files and folders that may be impacted by the changes being made, and will allow you to review them thoroughly during the code review process.

**Step 3: Identify files to review**

- Create a list in a markdown file of all the important files and folders to investigate.
- Update this list regularly to keep track of the most relevant parts of the codebase and to keep track of which files you have already reviewed and which ones you still need to review.

**Step 4: Review files**

- For each file, review the code and identify any potential issues, improvements, or important information that is relevant to the changes being made.
- Document your findings in the markdown file, including any specific lines of code or sections that are noteworthy.

**Step 5: Summarise review**

- After reviewing all the relevant files, compile your findings into a clear and concise summary that can be shared with the author of the changes.
- This summary should highlight any important issues or improvements that were identified, as well as any relevant information that may impact the changes being made.

**Step 6: Update documentation**

- If any documentation updates were necessary as part of the code review process, ensure that all relevant documentation is updated accordingly. This includes the README.md, codebase_notes.md, and any relevant documentation in the `conductor/` folder. Make sure to document any important information or changes that were identified during the code review process, so that it can be easily referenced in the future.

## PR review

- CodeRabbit performs a review of all PRs submitted to the repository, providing feedback on code quality, adherence to coding standards, testing, security implications, and overall impact on the project. The review process is designed to ensure that all changes meet the project's standards and align with its goals.
- When a PR is submitted, CodeRabbit will perform a code review that you must then review and resolve. The review will include feedback on any issues or improvements that were identified during the review process, as well as any relevant information that may impact the changes being made.

**Step 1: Review PR Findings**

- PR review findings file: The user will add a file under `conductor/code_reviews/` with the name `prXX_review_findings.md`, where `XX` is the number of the PR being reviewed. This file will contain a list of all the comments from the PR review, along with any relevant details or context provided by CodeRabbit.
- Review comments: Review the comments provided by CodeRabbit in the `prXX_review_findings.md` file, and ensure that you understand the feedback and suggestions provided. Take note of any specific issues or improvements that were identified, as well as any relevant information that may impact the changes being made.

**Step 2: Update the markdown file for documenting review findings**

- Update the PR review findings markdown file to be a ordered checklist. Include a number and a checkbox in front of each comment, and ensure that all details and context provided by CodeRabbit are included in the checklist. This will help you keep track of which comments have been addressed and which ones still need to be addressed as you work through the review process.

**Step 3: Address comments**

- Correct branch: Ensure you are in the correct branch for the PR and make the necessary code changes to address the comments provided by CodeRabbit.
- Review CodeRabbit feedback: For each comment, review the feedback provided by CodeRabbit in the `prXX_review_findings.md` file and make the necessary changes to address the issues or improvements identified. This may involve making code changes, updating documentation, or providing additional information to clarify any misunderstandings.
- Read the file: Before correcting any issue, first read the file that contains the comment to ensure you understand the context and details of the issue. This will help you make informed decisions about how to address the comment and ensure that your changes are effective and appropriate.
- Correct the issue: After understanding the comment, the context, and the broader purpose of the application, make the necessary code changes to address the issue. This may involve refactoring code, fixing bugs, improving performance, or making other relevant changes to ensure that the code meets the project's standards and aligns with its goals.
- Update checklist: As you address each comment, update the markdown checklist file in the `conductor/code_reviews/` folder to indicate which comments have been addressed and which ones still need to be addressed. This will help you keep track of your progress and ensure that all comments are properly addressed before finalizing the PR.

**Step 4: Resolve any errors**

- Check for errors: Run the following commands to ensure that the codebase is in a good state and that all tests are passing (use `;` for PowerShell or `&&` for cmd.exe):
  - `cd app && bun run lint` (mac) or `cd app ; bun run lint` (PowerShell) or `cd app && bun run lint` (cmd.exe) to check for any linting errors in the codebase.
  - `cd app && bun run test` (mac) or `cd app ; bun run test` (PowerShell) or `cd app && bun run test` (cmd.exe) to run all tests and ensure that they are passing successfully.
  - `cd app && bun run build` (mac) or `cd app ; bun run build` (PowerShell) or `cd app && bun run build` (cmd.exe) to ensure that the application can be built successfully without any errors.
  - `bunx vercel build` to check for any build errors and ensure that the application can be built successfully.

**Step 5: Summarise review**

- Summarise changes: After addressing all the comments, compile your findings into a clear and concise summary that can used as a commit message for the changes made to address the PR review. This summary should highlight any important issues or improvements that were addressed, as well as any relevant information that may impact the changes being made.

**Step 6: Update documentation**

- Update documentation: If any documentation updates were necessary as part of addressing the PR review comments, ensure that all relevant documentation is updated accordingly. This includes the README.md, codebase_notes.md, and any relevant documentation in the `conductor/` folder. Make sure to document any important information or changes that were made as part of addressing the PR review comments, so that it can be easily referenced in the future.

**Step 7: Finalize PR**

- Commit and push changes: Once all comments have been addressed and the necessary changes have been made, finalize the PR by pushing the changes to the branch. This will allow CodeRabbit to verify that all issues and improvements have been properly addressed and that the changes meet the project's standards.
- Do not commit findings: Do not commit the `prXX_review_findings.md` file to the repository, as this file is only meant for your reference during the PR review process and should not be included in the final codebase.

This will help maintain the overall quality and consistency of the project, and ensure that all team members have access to the most current information about the project.

# Additional Tools & Capabilities

## Chrome DevTools MCP

- **Usage:** Integrated for automated UI testing, accessibility audits, and real-time debugging of the digital prototype.
- **Key Actions:**
  - `list_pages`: Monitor open tabs and development servers.
  - `take_snapshot`: Analyze the accessibility tree and DOM structure.
  - `navigate_page` / `new_page`: Automated navigation.
  - `click` / `fill`: Interaction simulation.
- **Usage rules:**
  - Use MCP to verify UI changes before committing code.
  - Perform one step at a time to maintain context.
  - The Snapshots become stale as soon as you change something on the page, and a new snapshot is sent back from the tool call as a response.
  - Therefore perform one action at a time per tool call to maintain context. (e.g., "enter text in a field", etc.)
  - Then once you have received the new snapshot as a response, proceed with the next action. (e.g., "click submit button", etc.)

## Vercel CLI

- **Usage:** Run via `bunx vercel` from the **project root** directory.
- **Project Structure:** Managed from the root to ensure all documentation folders (`conductor/`, etc.) are uploaded for the `prebuild` rules generation script.
- **Dashboard Settings (Required):**
  - **Root Directory:** Empty (or `.`).
  - **Build Command:** `cd app && bunx convex deploy --cmd 'bun run build'`
  - **Install Command:** `cd app && bun install` (Override ON).
  - **Output Directory:** `app/dist`.
- **Purpose:** Use for manual deployments, inspecting build logs (`bunx vercel logs`), and verifying environment health. Before assuming a deployment is successful, use `bunx vercel list` to confirm status.

# Note to AI

- If you note something that is important or a potential improvement, please point it out, even if it is not directly related to the task at hand. For example, if you notice an import statement that is incorrect or a file structure that could be improved, please mention this to the user so they can make the necessary adjustments.
- Always communicate clearly and ask for clarification if you are unsure about any aspect of the project. Do not make assumptions, and if you are unsure about a design decision or implementation detail, review the code and ask for clarification rather than making assumptions.
- If you identify something important or noteworthy about the codebase, document it in `codebase_notes.md` for future reference.
